The layout in the application is written programmatically.

When we launch the application, a screen opens in front of us where we enter our name and age, as well as a button for adding children.

 By clicking on the "Add child" button, we have the opportunity to add up to 5 children. Once we've got 5 kids, the "Add Child" button disappears.

 It is also possible to remove each added child.

 When you click on the "Clear" button, all data is reset and the children are deleted.
